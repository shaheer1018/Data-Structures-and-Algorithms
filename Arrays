An array data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that stores a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory. 
It allows for efficient access to elements using indices and is widely used in programming for organizing and manipulating data.
An array is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type (java, c++), same + different data type (python) and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations. 
Arrays work on an index system starting from 0 to (n-1), where n is the size of the array.

Operations on Array in Python
Below are some operations that can be performed in an array:
append()
insert()
pop()
remove()
index()
reverse()

In java and c++ there are two different types of arrays static and dynamic arrays.
In python only dynamic arrays. 

Static arrays -> fixed memory size
Dynamic arrays -> variable or dynamic memory

Accessing the element of array by index will have Big O complexity of order of 1.
If we iterate over each element using a for loop then it will have Big O complexity of order of n.
